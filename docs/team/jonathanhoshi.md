### Project: Trackermon

Trackermon is a desktop application for tracking and managing shows, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Trackermon helps people track and remember what shows they have watched, are currently watching, or plan to watch.
